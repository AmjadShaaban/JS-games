Born in Wilmington DE, Grew up in the middle east. came back to "DelaWHERE??" after finishing High School. My coding journey started at a very young age in Syria, my first program I "typed" was in QuickBASIC language. I didn’t say "coded" because I didn’t know WTF I was typing! I was 3rd maybe 4th grade my father opened the compiler on our old (still alive) IBM XT 286, showed me a page with letters, numbers and symbols (10 years later I learned it's called "source code") and said: "If you type these lines exactly as they appear, you'll make a PC game". I was curious I compiled it and it ran!! since that time I’ve been fascinated and interested in twisting and manipulating compurters.
